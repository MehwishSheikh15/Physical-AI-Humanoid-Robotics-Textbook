## Prompt

now implement the /docs also in sidebar.ts

## Response snapshot

The agent updated the `ai-robotics-book/sidebars.ts` file to correctly reflect the new module structure from the `/docs` content. The outdated "Part X" categories were removed, and new categories for "Module 1: ROS2", "Module 2: GAZEBO", "Module 3: ISSAC", and "Module 4: VLA" were added, each utilizing `autogenerated` links for their respective weeks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Docusaurus sidebar updated with correct module structure.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `ai-robotics-book/sidebars.ts` modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Null
- 🧠 Reflection: Ensure the new sidebar configuration correctly reflects the content and navigation for users.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Verify the Docusaurus site builds and displays the sidebar correctly.
